# So sometimes I still feel like I should have lied
# I tell you the truth because I care
# But I also lie to you because I care
# But if I tell you the truth, I guess I can sleep better at night?
# But then it looks like I don't care because I'm telling you the truth
# I mean, I
# I guess I'm just not a
# Everybody hates when they get to that part when they realise that
# I don't wanna tell you I don't care, but if it seems like I don't care
# It doesn't mean I don't care
# It just looks like I don't care
# Because my emotions have been sanded off
